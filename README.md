This repository contains a variety of files and scripts I used while auditing the AIEA lab at UCSC under Dr. Leilani Gilpin to prepare for a research assistant role and my eventual masters project/thesis.

Code(s) for grading purposes:

TASK 2: see pylog_try.py

TASK 3: see petfacts.pl for my knowledge base and petpltest.py for the python script to query. 

TASK 5: see task5markdown.md

TASK 6 : see Assignment4.ipynb
